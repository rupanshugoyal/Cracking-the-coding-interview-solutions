1.4 Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forward and backwards.
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

Hints: 

#106. 1.4 You do not have to—and should not—generate all permutations. This would be very
inefficient. 

#134. 1.4 Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down to 0(N) time. 

#136. 1.4 Can you reduce the space usage by using a bit vector?
