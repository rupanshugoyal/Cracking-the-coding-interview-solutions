1.9 String Rotation; Assume you have a method isSubst ring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, si and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of si using only one
call to isSubst ring [e.g., "water bottle" is a rotation of 'erbottlewat"), 

Hints: 

#34, 1.9 If a string is a rotation of another, then it's a rotation at a particular point. For example,
a rotation of water bottle at character 3 means cutting water bottle at character 3
and putting the right half (erbottle) before the left half (wat). 

#88. 1,9 We are essentially asking if there's a way of splitting the first string into two parts, x and
y, such that the first string is xy and the second string is yx. For example, x = wat and
y = erbottle. The first string is xy = waterbottle. The second string is yx = erbottlewat. 

#104. 1.9 Think about the earlier hint. Then think about what happens when you concatenate
erbottlewat to itself. You get erbottlewaterbottlewat.
