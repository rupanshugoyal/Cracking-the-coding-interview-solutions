1.5 One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away. 

EXAMPLE
pale, pie -> true
pales, pale -> true
pale, bale -> true
pale, bake -> false

Hints: 

#23. 1.5 Start with the easy thing. Can you check each of the conditions separately? 

#97. 1.5 What is the relationship between the "insert character" option and the "remove character"
option? Do these need to be two separate checks?

#130. 1.5 Can you do all three checks in a single pass?
