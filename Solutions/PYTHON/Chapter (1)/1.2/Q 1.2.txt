1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

Hints:

#1. 1.2 Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other. Now, look at
that definition you provided. Can you check the strings against that definition?

#84. 1.2 There is one solution that isO(N log N) time. Another solution uses some space, but
isO(N) time. 

#122. 1.2 Could a hash table be useful?

#131. 1.2 Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but in different
orders. Can you make the orders the same?
