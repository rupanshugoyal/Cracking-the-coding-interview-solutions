1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures? 

Hints:

#44. 1.1 Try a hash table.

#117. 1.1 Could a bit vector be useful?

#132. 1.1 Can you solve it in 0(N log N) time? What might a solution like that look like?
