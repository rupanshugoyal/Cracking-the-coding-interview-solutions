1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.) 
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr 3ohn Smith"
Output: "Mr%203ohn%20Smith"

Hints: 

#53. 1.3 It's often easiest to modify strings by going from the end of the string to the beginning.

#118. 1.3 You might find you need to know the number of spaces. Can you just count them?
